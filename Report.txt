Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
    the objective was to predict whether or not applicants for funding will be successful 
    using the knowledge of machine learning and neural networks of the existing data.

Data Preprocessing
What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
    the following are considered
       IS_Successful
What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
    The following are considered
        EIN
        Name
        Application type   
        Affiliation
        Classificaiton
        Use_Case
        Organiziation
        Status
        Income_Amt
        Special_Consideration
        Aks_Amt
        Status
What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?
    Following were removed
        EIN
        Name
        Status = 0 
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
    The "Is successful" variable was our y-value
    The variables used as features are application type, affiliation, classificaiton, use case, organiziation, income amount, special considerations, and ask amount
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
    I used 5 layers. in order, they were Relu @ 80, tahn @ 55, tahn @35, Relu @ 25, and finally Signoid @ 1
        nn_model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=80, activation="relu", input_dim=dim))
        nn_model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=55, activation="tanh"))
        nn_model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=35, activation="tanh"))
        nn_model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=25, activation="relu"))
        nn_model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation="sigmoid"))
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
    I was not. the best model i could confidue ended at .72.90
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
    tried to increase the activation, change the actiation models
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
    After trying different activation models was wondering need to get some more knowledge of the the feature set to be  
    able to improve the precition with the dataset and remove unwanted
